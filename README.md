# biof501a-mbb659_jeremy_fan

idea of this project is to offer a dynamic workflow to call lineages
clinically relevant because physicians might notice everybody has a lineage from this one area of the world - perhaps in the future informing of local outbreaks 
currently, only 1 sample is processed, but for the imaginable future, more can be used.
