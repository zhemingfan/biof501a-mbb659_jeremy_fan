MissingOutputException in line 46 of /Users/owner/Documents/UBC/BIOF501A/term_project/biof501a-mbb659_jeremy_fan/Snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
data/lineage_report.csv
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
