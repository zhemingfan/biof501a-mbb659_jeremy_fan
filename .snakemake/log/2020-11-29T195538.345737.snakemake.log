Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	all
	1	create_csv
	1	produce_histogram
	3

rule create_csv:
    input: SRR11801823.fasta, SRR12960723.fasta
    output: results/first.csv, results/new.csv
    jobid: 1

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 65 of /Users/owner/Documents/UBC/BIOF501A/term_project/biof501a-mbb659_jeremy_fan/Snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
results/new.csv
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job create_csv since they might be corrupted:
results/first.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
